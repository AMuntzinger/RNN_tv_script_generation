## TV Script Generation with RNNs and Embeddings

This project generates new TV scripts with RNNs and Embeddings in PyTorch. The network is trained on existing TV scripts word by word, thus
learning to generate new scripts by predicting the most probable next word from a sequence of previous words. 

The notebook is an exercise of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Instructions

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- torch
